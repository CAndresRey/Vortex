# React + TypeScript + Vite
React + TypeScript + Vite Project
This repository provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It also includes a project description for building a user interface for a startup application that helps university students and novice researchers connect with expert writers.

Project Description
Build a user interface for a startup application that helps university students and novice researchers find expert writers. These writers can review, grade, assist in writing, and help build research papers. The application should ensure that students can trust the expert writers and know they will be able to support their research. Additionally, there should be a section (board) where expert writers can read documents, add comments, and correct the writing of the students' research papers. The service should be monetizable.

Deliverables
Graphic Design: Diagram the graphical pieces necessary to provide the conceptual image of the application.
Mockups: Build mockups of the complete application schema to define high-fidelity prototypes, using best practices and UX/UI concepts.
Design and Layout: Perform the design cuts and layout of the application for the web.
User Interface: Program the user interface from scratch in React, including:
Onboarding screen
Login screen
4 additional screens with a menu and a navbar suitable for an MVP
Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS
Authentication: JSON / JWT
Language: TypeScript
